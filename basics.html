<strong>History of Nellore District</strong>
<strike>the intellectual</strike>
<marquee behavior="" direction="left">Sarath is very good boy</marquee>
    Nellore was known by the name of Vikrama Simhapuri till 13th century. As far as history of the district is concerned, the district had an important role during the emergence of Telugu language and the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh. It had been under the rule of Maurya Dynasty, Satavahana Kings, Kakatiyas, Pallavas, Cholas, Telugucholas, Pandyas and other dynasties.
    
    Before the district was taken over the British it was ruled by the Nawabs. During the British rule the district was at peace and did not undergo any major political changes.
    
    The period after Indian independence brought about major political changes in the district. For instance till 1st October 1953, the district was part of the Madras (now Chennai) state but on 1st November, 1956 when the states were recognised on the basis of linguistic differences, the state of Andhra Pradesh came into existence. During that time Nellore had played an important role in the formation of the state and Potti Sriramulu, a Telugu patriot and activist had given a lot of effort to set up Andhra Pradesh.</p>
